## Description
 I worked on this project to learn more about web development and code.
 I built this project to see how different computer languages are linked together and to learn about website building.
 It solves the problem of tying different computer languages together in a project and also shows us how to execute different parts of each language to the console and to commit and push up to Github. It showed me how Github works with different branches and merging and coding within it. This project contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.
 I learned how to code. I learned about the different stages of coding. For instance, how to write different commands in the terminal. i also learned how to write and execute in vs code. I also learned how to push code up to the Github and make it public for everyone to check out.

## How to Contribute
