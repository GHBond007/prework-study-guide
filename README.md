Boot Camp Prework Study Guide for Students
# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
 I worked on this project to learn more about web development and code.
 This project showed how different computer languages are linked together to eventually create a static website.
 It solves the problem of tying different computer languages together in a project and also shows us how to execute different parts of each language to the console and to commit and push up to Github. It shows how Github works with different branches and also pull requests, merging, and cloning within it. This project contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.
 It thought me about the different stages of coding. For instance, how to write different commands in the terminal. I also learned how to write and execute in .vs code. This study guide showed how one builds a static website from opening a repository all the way to deploying the project.

To use this project you can read the notes in each section. 
For suggestions on what to study first open Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
